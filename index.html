            The orca, or "killer whale" (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale and is the largest member of the dolphin family. It is highly social and composed of matrilineal family groups.

            Orcas feed on fish, squid, birds, and marine mammals. Like dolphins, orcas use echolocation - bouncing sound off of objects to determine their location - to hunt and use a series of high-pitched clicks to stun prey.

            Like humans, Orcas ocassionally need to let loose to relieve the stress of a busy work week.  As a result of this, many underwater Orca nightclubs have sprung up over recent years.<br><br>Webpage created by Justin Gualtieri, Orca enthusiast.
